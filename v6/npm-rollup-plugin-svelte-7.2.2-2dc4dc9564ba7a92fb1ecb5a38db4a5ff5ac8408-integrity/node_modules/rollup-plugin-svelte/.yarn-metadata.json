    "readme": "> Undecided yet what bundler to use? We suggest using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) or Vite with [vite-plugin-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/).\n\n# rollup-plugin-svelte [![CI](https://github.com/sveltejs/rollup-plugin-svelte/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sveltejs/rollup-plugin-svelte/actions)\n\nCompile Svelte components.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev svelte rollup-plugin-svelte\n```\n\nNote that we need to install Svelte as well as the plugin, as it's a 'peer dependency'.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\n// rollup.config.js\nimport svelte from 'rollup-plugin-svelte';\nimport resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';\n\nexport default {\n  input: 'src/main.js',\n  output: {\n    file: 'public/bundle.js',\n    format: 'iife'\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    svelte({\n      // By default, all \".svelte\" files are compiled\n      extensions: ['.my-custom-extension'],\n\n      // You can restrict which files are compiled\n      // using `include` and `exclude`\n      include: 'src/components/**/*.svelte',\n\n      // Optionally, preprocess components with svelte.preprocess:\n      // https://svelte.dev/docs#compile-time-svelte-preprocess\n      preprocess: {\n        style: ({ content }) => {\n          return transformStyles(content);\n        }\n      },\n\n      // Emit CSS as \"files\" for other plugins to process. default is true\n      emitCss: false,\n\n      // Warnings are normally passed straight to Rollup. You can\n      // optionally handle them here, for example to squelch\n      // warnings with a particular code\n      onwarn: (warning, handler) => {\n        // e.g. don't warn on <marquee> elements, cos they're cool\n        if (warning.code === 'a11y-distracting-elements') return;\n\n        // let Rollup handle all other warnings normally\n        handler(warning);\n      },\n\n      // You can pass any of the Svelte compiler options\n      compilerOptions: {\n\n        // By default, the client-side compiler is used. You\n        // can also use the server-side rendering compiler\n        generate: 'ssr',\n\n        // ensure that extra attributes are added to head\n        // elements for hydration (used with generate: 'ssr')\n        hydratable: true,\n\n        // You can optionally set 'customElement' to 'true' to compile\n        // your components to custom elements (aka web elements)\n        customElement: false\n      }\n    }),\n    // see NOTICE below\n    resolve({\n      browser: true,\n      exportConditions: ['svelte'],\n      extensions: ['.svelte']\n    }),\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> **NOTICE:** You will need additional Rollup plugins. <br>Alone, this plugin translates Svelte components into CSS and JavaScript files. <br>You will need to include [`@rollup/plugin-node-resolve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-node-resolve) – and probably [`@rollup/plugin-commonjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-commonjs) – in your Rollup config.\n\n\n## Preprocessing and dependencies\n\nIf you are using the `preprocess` feature, then your callback responses may — in addition to the `code` and `map` values described in the Svelte compile docs — also optionally include a `dependencies` array. This should be the paths of additional files that the preprocessor result in some way depends upon. In Rollup 0.61+ in watch mode, any changes to these additional files will also trigger re-builds.\n\n\n## `svelte` exports condition\n\nIf you're importing a component from your node_modules folder, and that component's `package.json` has a `\"svelte\"` property in its `exports` condition...\n\n```js\n{\n  \"name\": \"some-component\",\n\n  // this means 'some-component' resolves to 'some-component/src/SomeComponent.svelte'\n  \"exports\": {\n    \".\": {\n      \"svelte\": \"./src/MyComponent.svelte\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n...then this plugin together with `@rollup/plugin-node-resolve` (and its `exportConditions` option containing the `'svelte'` condition – see configuration example above) will ensure that your app imports the *uncompiled* component source code. That will result in a smaller, faster app (because code is deduplicated, and shared functions get optimized quicker), and makes it less likely that you'll run into bugs caused by your app using a different version of Svelte to the component.\n\nConversely, if you're *publishing* a component to npm, you should ship the uncompiled source (together with the compiled distributable, for people who aren't using Svelte elsewhere in their app) and include the `\"svelte\"` property in the `exports` of your `package.json`.\n\nIf you are publishing a package containing multiple components, you can create an `index.js` file that re-exports all the components, like this:\n\n```js\nexport { default as Component1 } from './Component1.svelte';\nexport { default as Component2 } from './Component2.svelte';\n```\n\nand so on. Then, in `package.json`, set the `svelte` condition to point to this `index.js` file. Or you may create an export for each individual Svelte file. Using a single `index.js` which exports all files will allow multiple components to be imported with a single line, but may load more slowly during development. An export per file may load more quickly during development but require a separate import statement for each file.\n\n\n## Extracting CSS\n\nBy default (when `emitCss: true`) the CSS styles will be emitted into a virtual file, allowing another Rollup plugin – for example, [`rollup-plugin-css-only`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-css-only), [`rollup-plugin-postcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-postcss), etc. – to take responsibility for the new stylesheet. In fact, emitting CSS files _requires_ that you use a Rollup plugin to handle the CSS. Otherwise, your build(s) will fail! This is because this plugin will add an `import` statement to import the emitted CSS file. It's not valid JS to import a CSS file into a JS file, but it allows the CSS to be linked to its respective JS file and is a common pattern that other Rollup CSS plugins know how to handle.\n\nIf you set `emitCss: false` and your Svelte components contain `<style>` tags, the compiler will add JavaScript that injects those styles into the page when the component is rendered. That's not the default, because it adds weight to your JavaScript, prevents styles from being fetched in parallel with your code, and can even cause CSP violations.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
