This will work for both webpack and webpack-dev-server.\n\nGoes great with running cron jobs, reporting tools, or tests such as selenium, protractor, phantom, ect.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install --save-dev webpack-shell-plugin`\n\n## Setup\nIn `webpack.config.js`:\n\n```js\nconst WebpackShellPlugin = require('webpack-shell-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  ...\n  ...\n  plugins: [\n    new WebpackShellPlugin({onBuildStart:['echo \"Webpack Start\"'], onBuildEnd:['echo \"Webpack End\"']})\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n## Example\n\nInsert into your webpack.config.js:\n\n```js\nconst WebpackShellPlugin = require('webpack-shell-plugin');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nvar plugins = [];\n\nplugins.push(new WebpackShellPlugin({\n  onBuildStart: ['echo \"Starting\"'],\n  onBuildEnd: ['python script.py && node script.js']\n}));\n\nvar config = {\n  entry: {\n    app: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/app.js')\n  },\n  output: {\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // regular webpack\n    filename: 'bundle.js'\n  },\n  devServer: {\n    contentBase: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src') // dev server\n  },\n  plugins: plugins,\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      {test: /\\.js$/, loaders: 'babel'},\n      {test: /\\.scss$/, loader: 'style!css!scss?'},\n      {test: /\\.html$/, loader: 'html-loader'}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = config;\n\n```\nOnce the build finishes, a child process is spawned firing both a python and node script.\n\n### API\n* `onBuildStart`: array of scripts to execute on the initial build. **Default: [ ]**\n* `onBuildEnd`: array of scripts to execute after files are emitted at the end of the compilation. **Default: [ ]**\n* `onBuildExit`: array of scripts to execute after webpack's process is complete. **Default: [ ]**\n* `dev`: switch for development environments. This causes scripts to execute once. Useful for running HMR on webpack-dev-server or webpack watch mode. **Default: true**\n* `safe`: switches script execution process from spawn to exec. If running into problems with spawn, turn this setting on. **Default: false**\n* `verbose`: **DEPRECATED** enable for verbose output. **Default: false**\n\n### Developing\n\nIf opening a pull request, create an issue describing a fix or feature. Have your pull request point to the issue by writing your commits with the issue number in the message.\n\nMake sure you lint your code by running `npm run lint` and you can build the library by running `npm run build`.\n\nI appreciate any feed back as well, Thanks for helping!\n\n### Other Webpack Plugins\nAlso checkout our other webpack plugin [WebpackBrowserPlugin](https://github.com/1337programming/webpack-browser-plugin).\n\n### Contributions\nYair Tavor\n",
